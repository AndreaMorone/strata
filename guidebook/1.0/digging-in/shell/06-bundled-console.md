Strata can launch a console for you by invoking the `console` command.

{% include terminal_start.html %}
{% highlight bash linenos %}
$ ./strata console
{% endhighlight %}
{% include terminal_end.html %}

Information on how to use it when debugging can be found under [Using the console](/guidebook/1.0/digging-in/debugging/using-the-console/).
