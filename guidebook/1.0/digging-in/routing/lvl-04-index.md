Strata learns how to map requests to Controller objects through the configuration of different types of routes.

These routes can be as dynamic or static as you may need and the general flexibility of your application's routes will depend on the type of routes that you have implemented.

There are 3 types of routes : [Matched permalink routing](/guidebook/1.0/digging-in/routing/matched-permalink-routing/), [Resource routing](/guidebook/1.0/digging-in/routing/resource-routing/) and [Callback routing](/guidebook/1.0/digging-in/routing/callback-routing/).
