    <h2>A discreet MVC interface for Wordpress</h2>
</div>

<div class="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Wordpress is a fantastic bloging engine and is more and more used as a full fledged CMS. When building more complex websites or applications, one may find that you can't quite cleanly separate the business logic from the templating engine.</p>

    <p><em>Wordpress MVC</em> allows you to link permalinks with Controller actions to offer you an elegant coding method and keep the templates as clean as possible along with helping with customized database entries and view helpers.</p>
</div>

<div class="how">
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p><em>Wordpress MVC</em> is a Composer dependency that can be added to your application.</p>
    <p>Once the MVC is downloaded and configured, it stays out of the way until you need it.</p>

<div class="support">
    <h2>Is there support?</h2>
    <p>You can read <a href="/docs/">the documentation</a> for exemples on how to use any of the MVC features. You can also <a href="https://github.com/francoisfaubert/wordpress-mvc/issues">file in an issue on Github</a> if you have found something that doesn't quite work out the way you exected.</p>

    <p>Or you can send me a tweet or something.</p>
