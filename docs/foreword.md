## The state of the project

Bottom line : not yet ready to be used for projects that would not tolerate big changes to Strata's architecture.

However it should be ready in the upcoming weeks as I am solving issues daily on the project. Make sure to submit pain points and issues on our [Github](https://github.com/francoisfaubert/strata) to speed up this process.


## What's next

A last round of bug fixes is currently being performed. In the following days, two major websites using the framework will be launching. One of these will be a multilingual global portal that is projected to have thousands of hits a day.

These will be the first real-life stress tests on Strata. From there, the final patches will be made towards version 1.
