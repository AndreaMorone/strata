## The state of the project

Bottom line : not yet ready to be used for a real project.

However it should be ready in the upcoming weeks as I am solving issues daily on the project. Make sure to submit pain points and issues on our [Github](https://github.com/francoisfaubert/strata) to speed up this process.

Additionally, the documentation is not written with as much care as it deserves. I am French-speaking and writing in English is harder for me. I am also the one that coded Strata and I have a complete understanding of every concept and historical decisions. Because of this I expect I may not be explaining things in neutral, clear ways for other developers.

## What's next

Localization of dynamic objects are handled by the [Polyglot](https://github.com/francoisfaubert/polyglot) plugin, which is currently being completed.

Features such as the email manager and SQLite support will be bundled as Strata plugins to be required manually with Composer.
