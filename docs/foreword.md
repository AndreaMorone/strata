## The state of the project

Bottom line : not yet ready to be used for a real project.

However it should be ready "pretty soon" as I am solving issues daily on the project.

It is honestly still really early in the process of creating this tool but things move fast and convincingly. This means that it is quite possible there are issues when you are trying out the solutions.

Additionally, the documentation is not written with as much care as it deserves. I am french-speaking and writing in English is harder for me. I am also the one that coded and understand everything. I expect I may not be explaining the things developers want to know.

## What's next

I am committed in shipping a working release very soon as well as exposing the API and proper documentation. In the meantime, if you encounter spelling mistakes or inconsistencies in the code, please report them to me on GitHub (or even better contribute to the project!)

Here is my unofficial todo list, vaguely in the order which I plan to go by:

* While code is close to being in final condition, I am still finalizing concepts. Some of these concepts are not completed across the board (singular vs plural names, base classes inside vs base classes outside of descendant directory). This implies code that will be moved around.
* Improve the Vagrant machine to prevent weird bugs (no constant logging, clock out of sync, menu on reboot)
* Create a bin/mvc.bat counterpart for Windows
* Do screen casts
