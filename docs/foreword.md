## The state of the project

Bottom line : not yet ready to be used for projects that would not tolerate big changes to Strata's architecture.

However it should be ready in the upcoming weeks as I am solving issues daily on the project. Make sure to submit pain points and issues on our [Github](https://github.com/francoisfaubert/strata) to speed up this process.

Additionally, the documentation may not have been written with as much care as it deserves. I am French-speaking and writing formal documentation in English is harder for me. I am also the one that coded Strata and having a complete understanding of every concepts and historical decisions may distort what I see. For these reasons I expect I may not be explaining things in neutral, clear ways for other developers.

## What's next

Localization of dynamic objects and routes are handled by the [Polyglot](https://github.com/francoisfaubert/polyglot) plugin, which is currently being completed.

Features such as the email manager and SQLite support will be bundled as Strata plugins to be required manually with Composer.

There will be a need for User queries the same way we handle Post.
