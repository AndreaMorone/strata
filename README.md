### Modifying the code

1. Fork and clone the repository.
1. Run `composer update`.
1. Run `npm install`.

While coding, it's useful to have the test suite always running. You can do so by running our `grunt watch` task.

### Submitting Code

All code must be submit through pull requests. Obviously, you need to follow the conventions you see used in the source already.

1. Create a new branch, please don't work in your master branch directly.
1. Add failing tests for the change you want to make. Run 'grunt watch' to see the tests fail.
1. Repeat until the tests do not fail and your feature/fix is complete.
1. Update the documentation to reflect any changes. Be clear about what you have done.
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
